notes:
  - "No API, such as an ATOM feed, available."
  - "Parsing HTML is required."
  - "Images are unnecessarily packed into container files, such as ZIP."
  - "It is not possible to overlay images because a mask or alpha channel is missing."
  - "National license instead of an international standard."
  - "Rather than a national mosaic, inconsistent regional mosaics with different access and formats are available instead."
