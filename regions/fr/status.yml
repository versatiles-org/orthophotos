  - "No API, such as an ATOM feed, available."
  - "Parsing HTML is required."
  - "Images are unnecessarily packed into container files, such as 7ZIP."
  - "The images have a high resolution, but they are not stored in tiled mode, which makes them extremely slow to read."
  - "National license instead of an international standard."
