notes:
  - "No API, such as an ATOM feed, available."
  - "Hacky solution is required: Guessing filenames since there is no official index."
  - "Images are unnecessarily packed into container files, such as ZIP."
  - "Why are 1x1km tiles grouped into 2x2km containers? And why are the offsets not a multiple of 2?"
  - "License requires attribution."
  - "National license instead of an international standard."
  - "Rather than a national mosaic, inconsistent regional mosaics with different access and formats are available instead."
